    <strong>Warning!</strong> There are no available playbook directories in /var/lib/awx/projects. Either that directory
    is empty, or all of the contents are already assigned to other projects. Create a new directory there and make sure the
    playbook files can be read by the "awx" system user, or have Tower directly retrieve your playbooks from source control
    using the SCM Type option above.
